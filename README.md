# yellow-pack-additions
Minecraft mod for the Yellow Pack modpack

Unlike most mods, Yellow Pack Additions makes a lot of finalising changes. What I mean is that it will be trickier to make changes to a pack containing this mod, as many of the things that normally sit outside of jar (within reach) in this case sit inside of it. Namely, a great deal of recipe changes.

The reason for this is that this mod is designed for exclusive use in the Yellow Pack modpack, which itself is designed to be exclusively used on a specific private server.

Using it outside of this precise context is of course something you can do, but there will be hassles involved with doing so. I would suggest instead using it as a basis for creating a similar sort of thing.

The mod's Curseforge page can be found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yellow-pack-additions)

The modpack's Curseforge page will be linked here once it exists.
